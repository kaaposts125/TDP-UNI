        Monday is the first day of the week and it is both the most difficult and the easiest day. <b>The hardest part is that after the holidays, you have to start all over again</b> and get on with your daily routine. <b>Easier, because then the mind is still relatively relaxed</b> and able to absorb new information without much headache as at the end of the week. For me, they started early in the morning, even though there is only one C-class lecture in the evening. The reason is quite simple - work.
    </p>
    <p>
        Like many of my classmates, <b>I continue to work after the compulsory study program practice alongside my studies</b>, because why not train myself on top of university, but if seriously, this experience is a good way to get into my future and give me more independence in terms of money .
    <p>
    </p>
        As the day draws to a close, it\'s time to leave for the only lecture of the day - <b>Swedish.</b> The course is very specific. It seems the language itself is not that complicated on paper, but sometimes when you try to pronounce it or understand what is being said, you are stunned. The sounds you need to bring out sound like what you would emit when you were in first grade. Of course, this is not always bad, because often, in such words, everyone is successful in getting a belly press workout from laughing. <b>The lecturer is a person of years, but with a strong sense of humor</b>, knowledge and stories, which makes students especially happy because the lecturer tends to talk and the lecture seems to end sooner.
    <p>
    </p>
        And so the most important part of the day is closed and you can go home peacefully and relax, naively hoping that there are no university deadlines to stress…

    <p>
        Tuesday is the second day of the week, but it feels like a Monday because on Tuesday you don\'t feel that one day is over and <b>there are only four days left until the next holiday</b> seems to be over.
    </p>
    <p>
        For me, it started with a course called Mathematical Logic. The course is quite intense. Every week you have to do the <b>homework that you need to give in during each test</b>, which means that there is the greatest horror before the test, because rarely does the homework run smoothly, because "there is always enough time" to not ... the fact that it doesn\'t really teach you a formula, like in mathematics that you will need to apply during the test, but it does teach you to think in a certain way to get the results you need. <b>It is a slow process</b> to learn it, but some initially think that if they can keep track of a task, they have a school in hand and may not listen carefully to the lecture, but unfortunately this is not because <b>following an idea and having one are two different things.</b> Perhaps that is why many write their first test papers unsuccessfully, but whatever the case, this course must be studied diligently to be able to successfully complete it the first time. I have also felt as if I did not pay close attention to the lectures and how it affects the final grade.
    </p>
    <p>
        But Tuesday is the only lecture, so the rest of the day is spent on work issues and ends the day like Monday - with the naive expectation that there will be no university-related excitement to take a break between work days.

    <p>
        Wednesday is the third day of the week and the holy middle point of the working week, after which there will theoretically be less work to do until the next holiday. This is the day when, <b>in contrast to the first days of the week, there are several lectures</b> and they do not worry all day.
    </p>
    <p>
        It all started with hands-on sessions in the Mathematical Analysis II course, which looks at practical examples from last week\'s topic that don\'t have time in the lecture itself. <b>There is also often a look at homework that can be gotten, so to speak, "for free"</b> or compared to your score. The practical lecture is followed by the usual lecture of this course, where the new topic is covered at a fast pace. The tempo is that if you are distracted by an interesting fly in the audience, then the topic you are looking at next will be either completely different or nothing like what you saw before. 
    </p>
    <p> 
        This information marathon is followed by a more hands-on course on Database Practicality. Here we get to computers, change after, and list queries for the database. Each time there is a practical assignment, which can also be done at home, but <b>it is successfully forgotten every week and needs to be done smoothly on the spot before testing.</b> They are usually not complicated, and the materials are very useful in filling them. The course itself provides valuable insights into what can be done in databases. After these lectures, there is a moment of peace ... but no, it\'s not doomed, you can put a couple of spoons from lunch in your mouth and go to work until the last lecture of the evening, which is not really a lecture. As a second C course I chose RTU sports, more specifically basketball. Contrary to what others think, I did not play well, with all that I am tall, but it is nice to finally learn some basics of the game.
    </p>

        And with a tired body and mind, so get home and fall asleep.

        Thursday, if you can imagine, is the fourth day of the week. This day seems so suspicious that the weekend is coming soon, but <b>there is no peace at work or at university.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        The day started early, too early, with a lecture titled "Fundamentals of Web Design," which tells us about web design, its history, and (currently) good practice. <b>However, you will not see me there, because when the alarm rings at half past seven, sleep wins</b> almost always. At university, with a little delay, I come to the next lecture course on "Formal Grammar". The course is interesting, but slick, if you are not careful, you can, so to speak, "rub in" and not do any of the compulsory homework and not be allowed to write a test. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Next up is the "Database II" course, which is being taught at an impressive pace this year, and there is a lot of theory about the databases themselves <b>that does not personally link as much as the Practical Database Course</b>, where exactly the theoretical part of this course is practically tested. Continuing this is a short break where you can blow your head for a couple of hours until a special workshop arrives, where you can talk with colleagues and trainers about the technology in the world in a peaceful, friendly company.
    </p>
    <p>
        It\'s evening, but home is still far away. <b>You need to go to the "Web Design Basics" workshop</b>, where "film evenings" are held on PhotoShop topics. At the same time, we must complete the practical tasks we have been given.
    </p>
    <p>
        But now it\'s finally home and one day left to fight before the big break.

        Friday, the fifth and last working day of the week. It seems that only a day is left, but <b>it drags on the longest as any day.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>This day, by design, resembles Monday</b>, as most of it is spent working. It would seem that Friday should be a peaceful day, because everything has already been done on other days and there is not much work left, but unfortunately not because there is a hurry, both for yourself and for all those who could help you to calm down. 
    </p>
    <p>
        There is one lecture or lesson on this day, but it could not be called because it is a C course in RTU basketball. One might wonder why this course duplicated, because if "Wednesday" was read, it could also record that course. The story is that <b>this course requires you to attend it twenty times</b>, but less than twenty weeks per semester, so you need to attend it more often. It didn\'t help that it only started in September, but it can\'t be said that it\'s completely bad. It is a physical activity every week, which is impossible to ignore, because there is a desire to complete the semester.
    </p>
    <p>
        And with that, the work week is over and you can go and spend the rest of the evening with friends or at home, because it\'s a vacation and nothing to worry about. My grandfather would have said that I was going to hang around.

        Saturday is the sixth day of the week and the day you realize that it\'s not as free as you\'d like. The day started with a late start, because why get up early. Morning is slow as there is no hurry but <b>soon the phone starts ringing…</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        You don\'t see a name or number on your phone, but <b>an alarm reminding you to do homework</b> on "Formal Grammar," "Database II," the forgotten "Database Practice," and "Web Design Basics" tasks if you miss the practical tasks. 
    </p>
    <p>
        "Formal grammar" homework is not the hardest thing in the world, or something that will be reflected in the final grade, but <b>it just needs to be done</b> so that you don\'t have to go to the lecturer to retell the topic and take the test. I personally use them to gauge my level of understanding of the topic of the lecture, which also helps to prepare a little before the exam. Database II is not weekly, but <b>it takes some time to understand how to do the big homework</b> and tests, because in theory it is hard to listen if not interested during the lecture. The Database Practice is an interesting exercise that is fun to do and shakes your head when time is up. The “Web Design Basics” must have at least five tasks completed and they inspired some understanding of PhotoShop and looked at the different options for the future that you would inherently want to have. A nice tool to put your imagination to work.
    </p>
    <p>
        The day can end well if one of these homework is done, and then you can prepare for a real rest the next day.

        Sunday is the seventh and last day of the week, the day after which the weekly cycle begins again. Morning, as on weekends, is both late and slow. Today, peace in the world can calm down, but <b>still the phone rings and it is a message from your past self</b> that puts you on an extra load to make yourself better…
    </p>
    <p>
        Today we also have to do homework, but these are different. Homework must be done in the courses Mathematical Logic and Mathematical Analysis II. Mathematical logic <b>homework is time consuming and challenging</b>, even if you have listened to it and wrote it down during the lecture, even if you have not listened. These homework will be evaluated along with the test work. In a way, this homework is like a beginner\'s level kit for the test itself, which is like an expert level that requires the help of an older brother. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Mathematical Analysis II homework is optional, only at the very end, during the exam, if it is not passed, then <b>the resulting grade in the subject is reduced by one point</b> and should be completed, for example, to avoid becoming a top three. Similar to "Mathematical Logic" where these tasks prepare for tests and final exams, especially since the levels of difficulty are similar in both.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sunday is a successful time when you have enough time to eat lunch and complete one or another task to reduce the burden of the future on your sleepless nights to get those homework done. And it\'s Monday again tomorrow…
